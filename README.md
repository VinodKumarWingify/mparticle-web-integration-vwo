# ðŸ‘‹ Introduction

VWO is an optimization platform that allows websites to run experiments on their platforms to derive insights from visitor behavior and harness the results to amp up the conversion rate. Apart from experimentation, it also provides for personalization of the platform for different cohorts, fullstack implementation, and direct deployment of the changes determined through experimentation.

For more information check out our [website](https://vwo.com/ "VWO") and [documentation](https://developers.vwo.com/reference/introduction-1 "VWO Technical Documentation").

# mParticle Web Integration

A web integration (or a kit) is an extension to the core [mParticle Web SDK](https://github.com/mParticle/mparticle-javascript-sdk). It works as a bridge between the mParticle SDK and a VWO SDK. It abstracts the implementation complexity, simplifying the implementation for developers.

A kit takes care of initializing and forwarding information depending on what you've configured in [mParticle's dashboard](https://app.mparticle.com).
